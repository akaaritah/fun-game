It's a final (personal) project of a little game made in Angular for the Boolean Course.

Help the cat collect all required pumpkins for his halloween party!

## Gameplay

![alt text](/example.png)

Player can move using "A" and D" keys, to move left or right on the screen. When the player catch the pumpkin, they gain 1 point (visible on the top of the screen). 

When they reach 50 points, the game ends with a win. Additionally, when the player don't catch the pumpkin, they will lose 1 point. When they reach -10 points, they lose the game.

## About


This cat adventure is small and quick at the moment, but will be developed more in the future...

Ideas for future:

* Adding special pumpkins, quicker and worth 5 points;
* Adding 3 difficulties for the player to choose;
* Adding obstacles - player won't be able to move when colliding with them (probably they will be clouds);
* Adding powerups, that can appear on the screen. Player will gain either speed boost, or will be not colliding with obstacles for a short moment;



*All graphics (background, cat and pumpkins) are made by me.*
